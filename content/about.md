# Who am I?

As a software engineer with 2 years of experience in Python programming language and intermediate knowledge of JavaScript, I am well-versed in developing web applications using popular frameworks such as Django and Flask. I am also interested in exploring newer technologies such as FastAPI framework, Go, and Rust programming languages.

My passion lies in the fields of machine learning and AI, and I am eager to use my skills to develop software solutions that can analyze and process large amounts of data to make intelligent decisions. With my computer science background, I am interested in pursuing systems design with a focus on integrating machine learning into software systems.

Throughout my learning experiences, I have gained experience in software development best practices, including version control, testing, and code quality. I am committed to producing high-quality, maintainable, and scalable code and constantly strive to learn and implement the latest trends in software engineering.

My ultimate goal is to work on challenging projects that push the boundaries of what is possible with technology, and I am excited to bring my skills and knowledge to any team that values innovation and excellence.

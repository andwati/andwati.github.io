Take control of your artifacts

<!-- more -->

In my endless endevours to find the perfect note taking app led me to obsidian,  a note taking software that uses markdown files as the file format. All software is ephemereal in nature and yoour artifacts need to survive the decline of your favorite app. The files you create should be available to you and shouldt rrequire specialized software to access.

Your data shouldt be locked behind a paywall or an authentication system that is not under your control.

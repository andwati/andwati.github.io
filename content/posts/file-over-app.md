Take control of your artifacts

<!-- more -->

In my endless endeavors to find the perfect note taking app led me to obsidian,  a note taking software that uses markdown files as the file format. All software is ephemeral in nature and your artifacts need to survive the decline of your favorite app. The files you create should be available to you and shouldn't require specialized software to access.

Your data shouldn't be locked behind a paywall or an authentication system that is not under your control.

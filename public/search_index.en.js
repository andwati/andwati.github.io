The secret key must be a large random value and it must be kept secret. Leaking this value to unauthorized people could lead to a security breach. The SECRET_KEY is used in Django for cryptographic signing. It is used to generate tokens and hashes, they can be recreated using this variable. If it is not configured Django throws a django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty error\nUsing Environment Variables\nThe secret key should not be committed to version control.

It was first released in 1996 and has become one of the most popular RDBMSs in the world.\nPostgreSQL is designed to handle high levels of concurrency, providing features such as MVCC (multi-version concurrency control) that allow multiple users to access the same data simultaneously without conflicts. It is also highly extensible, with a large number of third-party extensions and libraries available that can be used to add functionality to the core database.\nSome of the key features of PostgreSQL include support for complex SQL queries, advanced indexing and query optimization, transactional integrity, and support for a wide range of programming languages and development frameworks.PostgreSQL is used by a wide range of organizations, from small businesses to large enterprises, and is particularly popular in industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, where high levels of data security and reliability are critical.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll look at how to install PostgreSQL 15 on Arch Linux, Manjaro, Garuda Linux, or any other Arch-based distro out there.\nPostgreSQL use cases\n\nE-commerce websites: PostgreSQL is a popular choice for e-commerce websites because it can handle large amounts of data and supports complex queries. It is used for product catalogs, order management, customer data, and more.\nFinancial institutions: PostgreSQL is used in financial institutions to store and manage transactional data, such as stock trades, bank transfers, and credit card transactions. It is highly secure and provides features such as transactional integrity and data encryption.\nHealthcare industry: PostgreSQL is used in the healthcare industry to store patient data, such as medical records and diagnostic test results. It is also used for research purposes, where large amounts of data need to be stored and analyzed.\nGovernment agencies: PostgreSQL is used by government agencies for a variety of purposes, including managing large datasets, storing and analyzing census data, and managing public health information.\nMobile and web applications: PostgreSQL is often used as a back-end database for mobile and web applications. It provides reliable data storage and retrieval and supports a wide range of programming languages and development frameworks.\nGeospatial applications: PostgreSQL has built-in support for geospatial data and is often used for applications that require location-based data, such as mapping and GPS tracking.\n\nWhy PostgreSQL?\nPostgres offers a lot of advantages that make it an excellent choice for highly transactional environments regardless of application size and data volume. Its rich feature set and flexibility make it a popular choice for a wide range of applications and industries. Some of the top features are:\n\nACID Compliance: PostgreSQL is ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, which means it provides high reliability, consistency, and data integrity, even in the presence of hardware failures, power outages, and other system errors.\nExtensibility: PostgreSQL is highly extensible, allowing developers to add new data types, operators, and functions using its extension framework. This makes it easy to customize PostgreSQL to meet the specific needs of your application.\nConcurrency: PostgreSQL provides a high level of concurrency, allowing multiple users to access the same data at the same time without conflicts. It uses a Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) model that enables fast and reliable access to data, even under heavy load.\nFull-text search: PostgreSQL provides a powerful full-text search engine that supports advanced search capabilities, such as stemming, ranking, and relevance matching.\nAdvanced indexing: PostgreSQL provides a wide range of indexing options, including B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, and BRIN. These indexing options allow developers to optimize database performance for their specific use cases.\nJSON support: PostgreSQL provides native support for storing and querying JSON data, making it easy to work with modern web and mobile applications that rely on JSON for data exchange.\nSecurity: PostgreSQL provides a high level of security, with features such as SSL support, client authentication, and role-based access control. It also provides encryption for both data at rest and data in transit.\nScalability: PostgreSQL is designed to scale horizontally and vertically, allowing you to add more nodes to a cluster or increase the resources of a single node to handle more load.\n\nInstall PostgreSQL on Arch | Manjaro | Garuda Linux\nNow with all that fluff out of the way, let's get to business. The steps have been tested on Arch Linux with the KDE desktop.\n\nNote:&nbsp;Commands that should be run as the&nbsp;postgres&nbsp;user are prefixed by&nbsp;[postgres]$&nbsp;in this article.\n\nStep 1: Installing the PostgreSQL Package\n$ sudo pacman -Syu postgresql\n\nThis command will update the package database and update all packages on the system then install the PostgreSQL package from your distribution mirrors. Never install a package without updating the system first. On a rolling release, this can lead to an unbootable system. Installing the package will also create a system user called&nbsp;postgres. You can now switch to the&nbsp;postgres&nbsp;user using a&nbsp;privilege elevation program.\nYou can switch to the PostgreSQL user by executing the following command:\n\n\nIf you have sudo and are in sudoers\n$ sudo -iu postgres\n\n\n\nOtherwise using su:\n$ su\n# su -l postgres\n\n\n\nStep 2: Initial Configuration\nBefore PostgreSQL can function correctly, the database cluster must be initialized.\n2.1 We can confirm the installed PostgreSQL version by running:\n$ postgres --version                                                                           ─╯\npostgres (PostgreSQL) 15.1\n\n2.2 Set applicable entries in&nbsp;/etc/locale.gen\n$ echo \"en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8\" | sudo tee /etc/locale.gen\n\n2.3 Then run&nbsp;**locale-gen**&nbsp;to generate locale settings\n$ sudo locale-gen\nGenerating locales...\n  en_US.UTF-8... done\nGeneration complete.\n\n2.4 Initialize Postgres Data Directory\nYou must first log in as the&nbsp;postgres&nbsp;user using the following command before you can initialize PostgreSQL’s data directory:\nsudo su - postgres\n\n2.5 With the following command, you can now initialize PostgreSQL’s data directory:\n[postgres]$ initdb -D /var/lib/postgres/data\n\nStep 3: PostgreSQL Service Management\n3.1 Check PostgreSQL status with the following command:\n$ systemctl status postgresql                                                                  ─╯\n postgresql.service - PostgreSQL database server\n     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; disabled; preset: disabled)\n     Active: inactive (dead)\n\n3.2 Start the PostgreSQL service by running the following command:\nsudo systemctl start postgresql\n\n3.3 Enable the PostgreSQL service to start automatically at boot by running the following command:\n$ sudo systemctl enable postgresql\n\n3.4 Verify that PostgreSQL is running by running the following command:\n$ sudo systemctl status postgresql                                                             ─╯\n● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL database server\n     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; preset: disabled)\n     Active: active (running) since Thu 2023-02-16 22:52:43 EAT; 20s ago\n   Main PID: 26106 (postgres)\n      Tasks: 6 (limit: 8790)\n     Memory: 16.9M\n        CPU: 113ms\n     CGroup: /system.slice/postgresql.service\n             ├─26106 /usr/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgres/data\n             ├─26107 \"postgres: checkpointer \"\n             ├─26108 \"postgres: background writer \"\n             ├─26110 \"postgres: walwriter \"\n             ├─26111 \"postgres: autovacuum launcher \"\n             └─26112 \"postgres: logical replication launcher \"\n\nResources\n\nArch Linux Wiki\nWikipedia\nPostgreSQL Documentation\n\nConclusion\nInstalling PostgreSQL on Arch Linux-based distribution is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few steps. By following the steps outlined above, you can install, configure, and start the PostgreSQL database server on your Arch Linux system. Once installed, you can use PostgreSQL to store, manage, and query data for a wide range of applications and use cases. With its advanced features and high level of extensibility, PostgreSQL is a popular choice for developers and businesses seeking a robust and reliable database management system.\nYou can connect to the PostgreSQL server using the psql command-line client or a graphical tool such as pgAdmin.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/install-postgresql-15-on-arch-manjaro-garuda-linux/","title":"Install PostgreSQL 15 on Arch | Manjaro | Garuda Linux"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/integrating-netlify/":{"body":"Migrating to a better content management system through Netlify CMS\n\nHeavy Lifting\nI use Visual Studio Code to manually edit the blog post content on this website. This is quite a hassle because I have to deal with\nmarkdown files. There are many problems with this approach and several gotchas. I have to work on a local site repository to be able to edit the content. My GitHub credentials are also required to push my local changes to my remote repository on GitHub so that it can trigger the build process and publish the site.\nThis process has helped me a lot to master markdown syntax and some practice on my git skills. It’s fun to update the website content following these steps but sometimes it can be frustrating. At those times, I really miss the user interface of content management systems. After careful consideration, I moved on with Netlify CMS. At its core, Netlify CMS is an open-source React app that acts as a wrapper for the Git workflow, using the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket API. This provides many advantages, including:\n\nFast, web-based UI: With rich-text editing, real-time preview, and drag-and-drop media uploads.\nPlatform agnostic: Works with most static site generators.\nEasy installation: Add two files to your site and hook up the backend by including those files in your build process or linking to our Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nModern authentication: Using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and JSON web tokens.\nFlexible content types: Specify an unlimited number of content types with custom fields.\nFully extensible: Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins.\n\nRedeploying to Netlify\nI decided to move the site from GitHub pages to Netlify hosting to take full control of the platform. Hugo sites on Netlify can benefit from automatic framework detection and control over Hugo version selection. When you link a repository for a project, Netlify tries to detect the framework your site is using. If your site is built with Hugo, Netlify provides a suggested build command and publish directory: Hugo and public. The build process is straight forward but you can add custom options to your netlify.toml file, here are my options:\n[build]\ncommand = \"hugo\"\npublish = \"public\"\n\n[build.environment]\nHUGO_VERSION = \"0.105.0\"\n\nSetting up Netlify CMS\nYou can adapt Netlify CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. You can Netlify CMS to a site that's built with a common static site generator, like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. The official documentation for installing on your website can be found at the official site\nSteps\nStep 1\nCreate a static admin folder containing all Netlify CMS files, stored at the root of your published site. Where you store this folder in the source files depends on your static site generator. For Hugo, it is the static folder.\n/static/admin\nStep 2\nInside the admin folder, create two files: index.html and config.yml. The first file admin/index.html is an entry point to Netlify CMS. You will access the CMS interface from yourwebsite.com/admin when everything is ready.\nStep 3\nThe first file, admin/index.html, is the entry point for the Netlify CMS admin interface. Paste this code in index.html and save. This HTML starter page will load the Netlify CMS Javascript file:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Content Manager&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Include the script that builds the page and powers Netlify CMS --&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nStep 4\nNow let’s move to the configuration section. These are the configurations that go into the config.yml file. This process is different for every site. I followed the guidelines on the website and made minor adjustments. It worked on my website. The configuration options are available at the docs. This is how I configured my config.yml file:\nbackend:\n  name: git-gateway\n  branch: netlify-cms # Branch to update (optional; defaults to master)\n\n# This line should *not* be indented\npublish_mode: editorial_workflow\n\nmedia_folder: \"static/images/uploads\" # Media files will be stored in the repo under static/images/uploads\npublic_folder: \"/images/uploads\" # The src attribute for uploaded media will begin with /images/uploads\n\ncollections:\n  - name: \"post\" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog\n    label: \"posts\" # Used in the UI\n    folder: \"content/post\" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored\n    create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection\n    slug: \"{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}\" # Filename template, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title.md\n    fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter\n      - { label: \"Layout\", name: \"layout\", widget: \"hidden\", default: \"blog\" }\n      - { label: \"Title\", name: \"title\", widget: \"string\" }\n      - { label: \"Draft\", name: \"draft\", widget: \"boolean\", default: true }\n      - { label: \"Publish Date\", name: \"date\", widget: \"datetime\" }\n      - { label: \"Last Modified\", name: \"lastmod\", widget: \"datetime\" }\n      - { label: \"Body\", name: \"body\", widget: \"markdown\" }\n      - { label: \"Keywords\", name: \"keywords\", widget: \"list\" }\n      - { label: \"Tags\", name: \"tags\", widget: \"list\" }\n      - { label: \"Categories\", name: \"categories\", widget: \"list\" }\n      - { label: \"Comments\", name: \"comment\", widget: \"boolean\", default: true }\n      - {\n          label: \"Table of Contents\",\n          name: \"toc\",\n          widget: \"boolean\",\n          default: true,\n        }\n\nStep 5\nAuthentication\nNow that the Netlify CMS files are in place and configured, all that's left is to enable authentication.\nNetlify offers a built-in authentication service called Identity. In order to use it, connect your site repo with Netlify. Netlify has published a general Step-by-Step Guide for this, along with detailed guides for many popular static site generators\nLet’s first enable Netlify Identity and Git Gateway:\n\nOn your Netlify account, go to Settings &gt; Identity and select Enable Identity Service\nUnder Registration preferences, select Invite Only.\nIf you want to enable login from external providers such as Google and GitHub, check the boxes you want to use, under External Providers section. I find it practical to log in with GitHub, so I added it.\nGo to Services &gt; Git Gateway, and click Enable Git Gateway. This authenticates with your Git Host and generates and API token.\nEverything is almost set up. What we need now is a front-end interface to connect. We will add the following script in two places, to include the Netlify Identity Widget on our website:\n\n&lt;script src=\"https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nWe will use Netlify's script injection feature to add the script to our site. To use snippet injection, go to Site Settings &gt; Build &amp; Deploy &gt; Post processing. Find the Snippet Injection section and select Add Snippet. Write a name for the script in the first box (e.g. Netlify Identity Widget). Paste the script inside the second box. Choose Insert before the &lt;/body&gt; option and save.\nLastly, we will add the following script before the closing &lt;body&gt; tag of our website’s main index page. This script allows the user to redirect back to the /admin/ path after completing the login with the Netlify Identity Widget:\n&lt;script&gt;\n  if (window.netlifyIdentity) {\n    window.netlifyIdentity.on(\"init\", (user) =&gt; {\n      if (!user) {\n        window.netlifyIdentity.on(\"login\", () =&gt; {\n          document.location.href = \"/admin/\";\n        });\n      }\n    });\n  }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nStep 5\nNow we’re all set. Since we set our registration preferences to “Invite Only”, we need to invite ourselves as site users. To do this, select the Identity tab from the Netlify site dashboard and select the Invite Users button. Add your email address and send an invitation. You will receive an email. In your email, click “accept the invitation”. You will be directed to your website admin sign-up panel. Choose a password. Now you are ready to log in to Netlify CMS.\nSetting up a custom domain\nI﻿ bought a custom domain from Namecheap, they provide some pretty good deals. After pointing the nameservers for the domain to the Netlify nameservers, voila! everything worked smoothly. For HTTPS support, Netlify enables automatic TLS certificates with Let’s Encrypt.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/integrating-netlify/","title":"Integrating Netlify CMS"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/second/":{"body":"This is my second blog post.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/second/","title":"My second post"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/semantic-version-and-conventional-commits/":{"body":"A﻿dopting best practices in your git and build workflows.\n\nW﻿hat is Semver?\nSemantic versioning or just SemVer is a dependency naming guidline that aims to bring some sanity into naming libraries and packages in software development. It is a standard versioning system created by Tom Preston Werner (co-founder of Github) that’s used to communicate what changes are in a release.\nAn efficient and smooth versioning becomes crucial for efficient software delivery expecially for projects that expose a public API. This saves the developers the chaos that is dependency hell.Dependency hell is a colloquial term for the frustration of some software users who have installed software packages which have dependencies on specific versions of other software packages.\nThe dependency issue arises when several packages have dependencies on the same shared packages or libraries, but they depend on different and incompatible versions of the shared packages. If the shared package or library can only be installed in a single version, the user may need to address the problem by obtaining newer or older versions of the dependent packages. This, in turn, may break other dependencies and push the problem to another set of packages.\nSemantic Versioning Specifications\nSummary\nSemantic versioning is based on three numbers that indicate the versions of the software and the compatibilities.They are X.Y.Z correspondind to Major.Minor.Patch\n\n**Major Version (X):**Introduces major changes to the code and breaking changes toward backward compatibility\nMinor Version (Y): These code changes don’t introduce breaking changes. This could be adding a new feature that doesn't break changes but are not exactly bug fixes.\nPatches (Z): Mainly correspond to bug fixes\n\nExamples in common packages\nReact(v18.2.0)\n\n\nMajor -&gt; 18\nMinor -&gt; 2\nPatch -&gt; 0\n\n\nPipx(v1.1.0)\n\n\nMajor -&gt; 1\nMinor -&gt; 1\nPatch -&gt; 0\n\n\nStart at v0.1.0 or v1.0.0?\nConvention recommends that in the initial development phase the starting version should be 0.1.0 which makes sense since it’s not in production yet.\nThe version should only be bumped to 1.0.0 only if it is being used in production and stable.\nIf your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.\nConventional Commits\nConventional Commits is a convention on top of commit messages that are used to automate version changes. It provides an easy set of rules for creating commit messages and works well with SemVer by describing features, fixes and breaking changes that correspond to SemVer standards.\nSummary\nThe commit message should be structured as follows:\n&lt;type&gt;[optional scope]: &lt;description&gt;\n\n[optional body]\n\n[optional footer(s)]\n\nThe commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:\n\nfix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).\nfeat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).\nBREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.\ntypes other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.\nfooters other than BREAKING CHANGE:  may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.\n\nResources\nhttps://semver.org/\nhttps://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/semantic-version-and-conventional-commits/","title":"Semantic Versioning(SemVer) and Conventional  Commits"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/subresource-integrity/":{"body":"Understanding Subresource Integrity\n\nIn my junior year while I was learning HTML and CSS I got to use the Bootstrap css library.The easiest way to obtain the files was from a Content Delivery Network(CDN). I could see links such as:\n&lt;link\n  href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\"\n  rel=\"stylesheet\"\n  integrity=\"sha384-KK94CHFLLe+nY2dmCWGMq91rCGa5gtU4mk92HdvYe+M/SXH301p5ILy+dN9+nJOZ\"\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n/&gt;\n\nI didn't bother with the integrity attribute of the link(guess I wasn't curios enough). The integrity attribute has a cryptographic hash value that is important in CDNs and its called the Subresource Integrity.\nSubresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature in web browsers that helps prevent malicious or compromised scripts from being loaded and executed on a website.a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match.\nWhen a resource, such as a script or stylesheet, fails the SRI check, the browser will block the resource from being loaded and displayed on the website.\nHow Subresource Integrity Helps\nSubresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that helps protect against certain types of attacks, such as those that involve malicious modifications to third-party resources that a website loads.\nSRI works by allowing a website to specify a cryptographic hash for a particular external resource (such as a JavaScript file or a CSS stylesheet) that it expects to load. When a user's browser fetches that resource, it checks the hash against the actual contents of the resource. If the hash doesn't match, the browser will refuse to load the resource, indicating that it may have been tampered with.\nThis can help prevent a variety of attacks, such as those involving a compromised content delivery network (CDN) or a man-in-the-middle attacker who intercepts and modifies network traffic. By using SRI, a website can help ensure that it is loading only the resources it expects, and that those resources have not been tampered with in transit.\nUsing it\nUsing Subresource Integrity (SRI) involves a few steps, but it is relatively straightforward.An integrity value begins with at least one string, with each string including a prefix indicating a particular hash algorithm (currently the allowed prefixes are sha256, sha384, and sha512), followed by a dash, and ending with the actual base64-encoded hash.\n\n\nGenerate a cryptographic hash(a base64-encoded cryptographic hash) of the external resource you want to load on your website. This can be done using a hash function such as SHA-256.\n\n\nAdd the hash as an attribute to the tag that loads the external resource. For example, for a JavaScript file, you would add the integrity attribute to the &lt;script&gt; tag like this:\n\n\n&lt;script\n  src=\"https://example.com/example.js\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-ABC123XYZ456\"\n&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nAn integrity value may contain multiple hashes separated by whitespace. A resource will be loaded if it matches one of those hashes.\n\nMake sure the hash you've generated matches the actual contents of the external resource.\nTest your website to ensure that the external resource is loading correctly and that the SRI feature is working as intended.\nTools for generating SRI hashes\nYou can use a tool such as the SRI Hash Generator to generate the hash and check it against the file's contents.\nYou can generate SRI hashes from the command-line with openssl using a command invocation such as:\ncat FILENAME.py | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A\n\nor with shasum using a command invocation such as:\nshasum -b -a 384 FILENAME.js | awk '{ print $1 }' | xxd -r -p | base64\n\n\nThe pipe-through xxd step takes the hexadecimal output from shasum and converts it to binary.\nThe pipe-through awk step is necessary because shasum will pass the hashed filename in its output to xxd. That can have disastrous consequences if the filename happens to have valid hex characters in it — because xxd will also decode that and pass it to base64.\n\nIn a Windows environment, you can create a tool for generating SRI hashes with the following code:\n@echo off\nset bits=384\nopenssl dgst -sha%bits% -binary %1% | openssl base64 -A &gt; tmp\nset /p a= &lt; tmp\ndel tmp\necho sha%bits%-%a%\npause\n\nTo use that code:\n\nSave that code in a file named sri-hash.bat in the Windows SendTo folder in your environment (for example, C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SendTo).\nRight-click a file in the File Explorer, select Send to…, and then select sri-hash.

For example, the header could include a wildcard (*) to allow any domain to access the resource.\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n\nHow browsers handle Subresource Integrity\nWeb browsers employ several mechanisms to handle Subresource Integrity (SRI). When a &lt;script&gt;** or &lt;link&gt; element with an integrity attribute is\nencountered by the browser, it compares the script or stylesheet to the expected hash given in the integrity value before executing the script or applying the stylesheet.\nFor resources served from a different domain than the document in which it's embedded, the browser also checks the resource using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to ensure that the origin serving the resource allows it to be shared with the requesting domain. This additional check is important for preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.\nIf the script or stylesheet fails to match its associated integrity value, the browser will refuse to execute the script or apply the stylesheet and return a network error, indicating that the fetching of that script or stylesheet failed. This behavior ensures that the resource being loaded is trustworthy and helps to protect users from potential security threats.\nReferences\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP\nhttps://www.srihash.org/\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity\nhttps://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-script-integrity\nhttps://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-link-integrity\nhttps://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/#the-integrity-attribute\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/subresource-integrity/","title":"Subresource Integrity"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/archive/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/first/":{"body":14,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/generate-django-secret-key/":{"body":111,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/hello-world/":{"body":152,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/install-postgresql-15-on-arch-manjaro-garuda-linux/":{"body":845,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/integrating-netlify/":{"body":849,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/second/":{"body":3,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/semantic-version-and-conventional-commits/":{"body":354,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/subresource-integrity/":{"body":626,"title":2}},"length":11},"lang":"English"};
